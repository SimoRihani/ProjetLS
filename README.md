# LS-Project / Evaluate !

## Synopsis
Evaluate ! is a tool to evaluate different alternatives, by making a ranking from the best one to the worst.
Based on two documents to be attached : the first for the desired configuration (different weightings of the criteria) and the second for the data, you can apply one of the three evaluation methods available.

The client side is developed with jQuery and Bootstrap, and the server side with Python through Flask framework.
